Regarding the square root task. As requested, the time complexity must be O(logn) and the right algorithm to use is a binary search. Here we have visualized an array between 0-n, n is the number that we want to find its sqrt. I said visualized array because all the function takes is start and end numbers not an array of all the numbers between these boundaries. That leads to space complexity to have the value of O(1) since we only store some variables and of course the space for each function call in the call stack.
