# DS-and-Algo-Nanodegree
This repo includes the 4 assignments for Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree by Udacity. In each task, analysis of time and space 
complexity must be provided besides the solutions.

For the first project, data sets containing calls and texts were given to extract data according to each task - task description is provided in the solution file. 
This project contains five simple tasks to apply python knowledge in dealing with inputs and outputs. It's basically a warm-up for this course.

Regarding the second project, it contains six different problems to check knowledge of different Data structures that were discussed 
in the course, for ex: heap, ordered-dict ... etc

While the third project contains questions that cover a variety of topics related to the basic algorithms discussed in this course 
like binary search, divide and conquer, and more.

Finally, in order to graduate and get a certificate a final project must be completed. This course's final project was to
use A* search to implement a "Google-maps" style route planning algorithm.
