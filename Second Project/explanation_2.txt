Regarding file recursion task. As it clearly a problem that can be divided to sub-problems, that means it would be solved by recursion. I used a list to store each file's path that ends with (suffix). Time complexity is gonna be O(n), where n in the number of file/sub-dir in the main directory. Other operations like len and append will take constant time, that can be discrded. About listdir, will take O(n) since it will iterate through each file/sub-dir. The rest of os operations as i assume will take constant time. I don't have a solid information about it.
Space complexity will be O(k), k is the number of files that ends with suffix.
