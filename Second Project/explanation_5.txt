Regarding blockchain task. The idea is to use a linked list, each node is a block in the blockchain. Each node will be linked to the next one and the next node will have the previous hash value. The edge case will be if we tried to add two blocks that have the same time.
Time complexity is O(n) for insertion. Inserting the block into the linked list is gonna take O(1) since I preserve the tail block, but add the block’s time into the times’ list will take O(n). In addition, the print process of the whole blockchain will take O(n).
Space complexity will be n * the size of the block object. In addition to the list of times.
